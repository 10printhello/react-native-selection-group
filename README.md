# react-native-selection-group

react-native-selection-group is the simplest way to create exclusive, or multi-selection groups of UI elements. From simple radio buttons, and survey questions, to any imaginably more complex use case.

The main benefit of this component is that it doesn't dictate to you how your UI will be drawn, it handles all the state and calls a render function you provide.
